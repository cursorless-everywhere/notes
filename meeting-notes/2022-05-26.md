# Thursday 5/26/2022

@phillco, @pokey

Note: this session is pretty heavily focused on JetBrains, but substitute with "
the non VS Code editor" wherever appropriate.

## What's working today?

- A new JetBrains plugin in Kotlin that uses event listeners, and serializes
  editor state to a file (namespaced by PID) for each JetBrains instance.
- This should have long term benefits, beyond just Cursorless, because Talon can
  now simply read the PID state file for the current editor to find information
  about it. (Today, everything has to go through synchronous HTTP requests
  JetBrains, and sometimes those block if UI is showing.).
  - It could also watch it to be proactively notified about state changes.
- A "sidecar" VS Code extension watches this state file, and makes VS Code mimic
  the same file/path/visible area whenever it changes.
    - Anecdotally, this is pretty snappy!
- A fork of the Cursorless repository (https://github.com/phillco/cursorless)
  writes out the hats to a file (`~/.vscode-hats.json`) whenever they change.
- Code inside of the new JetBrains plugin renders the hats inside of the editor:

## What's not working?

- VS Code only looks at the saved version of the file, so as soon as you make
  changes, not only do they not get hats but the hats live in the wrong
  positions.
    - This is especially true if you add or remove lines, since they will be
      hanging out in empty space.
    - Unlike with VS Code, the existing hat positions don't get "rebased" as you
      change line positions around (e.g. add a new line just before a line 
      with hats on it -- VS Code atomically moved the hats with the line; 
      JetBrains doesn't).
- We verify that the file name of the hats file matches the file name of the
  current editor, but otherwise it's possible to have an entirely stale hats
  file with old data.
- JetBrains only redraws the graphics context when it thinks it needs to (e. g.,
  after the user types, scrolls, etc.). However, the final update of the hats in
  reaction to that change will come later (~100ms). But JetBrains won't
  automatically redraw the editor because it doesn't know it needs to.
- Therefore, we have a file watcher to do this -- it watches the hats file and
  triggers a redraw whenever it changes. But this seems to be slightly glitchy,
  don't think it's removing the old hats properly. You can tell because
  scrolling the editor slightly (which will trigger JetBrains to redraw
  everything, but not enough to actually change the hats) "fixes" things.
- There's no way to run commands yet.

## What's next for the prototype?

See MILESTONES.md for most of it.

## Notes / learnings:

- VS Code plugins are single threaded (VS Code itself has multiple JS engines.
  The editor has its own, but all plugins share a single one)
- Extension interoperation: extensions can return stuff from `activate()` which
  could be called by other extensions. See `getExtensionApi.ts`
    - This is pretty handy, because we can have the sidecar extension (better
      name needed) and Cursorless talked to each other as needed.
- Every VS Code window is its own instance (with its own command server). It can
  be difficult to figure out which window is focused/frontmost.
    - If they ran HTTP servers, each one would need its own port.
    - Again, probably not a problem for the Cursorless Everywhere user since
      they won't be using VS Code otherwise.
        - Although if we will have mixed users, we could consider running a
          special version of VS Code just for the sidecar.
- Cursorless commands use async/await and return promises which _do not fulfil
  until VS Code has updated all of the listeners registered about those
  changes_ (cool!)
    - Thus, it might be possible to accumulate all the diffs that were generated
      during the course of running a single cursorless command, because of the
      single threaded aspect of plugins + promise contract.
- Therefore -- whoever triggers the invocation of the cursorless command
  (via command server?) could also collect all of the editor diffs associated
  with that command, and send them to JetBrains.

## Medium term

- `addDecorationsToEditors`: this is a nicely abstractable function that we
  could use as the first piece to break out of the VS Code dependency.
    - It could basically be run in isolation to "generate hats on this
      in-memory, abstracted editor state and return them to me as a dictionary".
    - This isn't very useful for us in the short term however, because we
      actually _do_
      need the hat state to be persisted everywhere -- other pieces of
      Cursorless functionality depend on it -- so we're not going to pursue
      this.
    - @pokey mention that it is likely that this gets broken out though, because
      rango needs it.

## How should commands get to VS Code?

Two worlds:

1. commands go to VS Code (this is how it works) **(world one)**
    - this is simplest to get started. We simply add `app: jetbrains` to
      cursorless.talon, and then make the transmission of commands work without
      VS Code focused (see MILESTONES.md)
    - it would be nice if we could block the cursorless talon action on the
      synchronization being applied
2. commands go to JetBrains, which forwards them to VS Code **(world two)**
    - we need to have a synchronous way for JetBrains to talk to VS Code, which
      today it does not
    - this _could_ be a reimplementation of the existing command client, but
      perhaps not necessarily
    - assuming the above is resolved:
        - the sidecar would run the command but also record all the diffs that
          were created during the course of running it and return them back to
          JetBrains
        - and if JetBrains ran everything then we could do this synchronously
