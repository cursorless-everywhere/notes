## What's working today?

- New JetBrains plugin in Kotlin that uses event listeners, and serializes 
  editor state to a file (namespace by PID) for each JetBrains instance.
- This should have long term benefits because Talon can simply read (or 
  watch) the PID state file for the current editor to be proactively 
  notified about changes.
  - (Today, everything has to go through synchronous HTTP requests JetBrains)
- A "sidecar" VS Code extension watches this state file, and makes VS Code 
  mimic the same file/path/visible area whenever it changes.
  - Anecdotally, this is pretty snappy!
- A fork of the Cursorless repository (https://github.com/phillco/cursorless)
  writes out the hats to a file (`~/.vscode-hats.json`) whenever they change.
- Code inside of the new JetBrains plugin renders the hats inside of the editor:

## Notes / learnings:

- VS Code plugins are single threaded (VS Code itself has multiple JS 
  engines. The editor has its own, but all plugins share a single one)
- Extension interoperation: extensions can return stuff from `activate()` which
  could be called by other extensions. See `getExtensionApi.ts`
  - This is pretty handy, because we can have the sidecar extension (better name
    needed) and Cursorless talked to each other as needed.
- Every VS Code window is its own instance (with its own command server). It can
  be difficult to figure out which window is focused/frontmost.
  - If they ran HTTP servers, each one would need its own port.
  - Again, probably not a problem for the Cursorless Everywhere user since
    they won't be using VS Code otherwise.
    - Although if we will have mixed users, we could consider running a 
      special version of VS Code just for the sidecar.
- Cursorless commands use async/await and return promises which _do not fulfil
  until VS Code has updated all of the listeners registered about those
  changes_ (cool!)
    - Thus, it might be possible to accumulate all the diffs that were generated
      during the course of running a single cursorless command, because of the
      single threaded aspect of plugins + promise contract.
- Therefore -- whoever triggers the invocation of the cursorless command
  (via command server?) could also collect all of the editor diffs associated
  with that command, and send them to JetBrains.

## Medium term

- `addDecorationsToEditors`: this is a nicely abstractable function that we
  could use as the first piece to break out of the VS Code dependency.
    - It could basically be run in isolation to "generate hats on this
      in-memory, abstracted editor state and return them to me as a dictionary".
    - This isn't very useful for us in the short term however, because we
      actually _do_
      need the hat state to be persisted everywhere -- other pieces of
      Cursorless functionality depend on it -- so we're not going to pursue
      this.
    - @pokey mention that it is likely that this gets broken out though, because
      rango needs it.

## How should commands get to VS Code?

Two worlds:

1. commands go to VS Code (this is how it works) **(world one)**
    - this is simplest to get started. We simply add `app: jetbrains` to
      cursorless.talon, and then make the transmission of commands work without
      VS Code focused (see MILESTONES.md)
    - it would be nice if we could block the cursorless talon action on the
      synchronization being applied
2. commands go to JetBrains, which forwards them to VS Code **(world two)**
    - we need to have a synchronous way for JetBrains to talk to VS Code, which
      today it does not
    - this _could_ be a reimplementation of the existing command client, but
      perhaps not necessarily
    - assuming the above is resolved:
        - the sidecar would run the command but also record all the diffs that
          were created during the course of running it and return them back to
          JetBrains
        - and if JetBrains ran everything then we could do this synchronously
