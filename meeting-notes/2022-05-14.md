@pcohen, @rntz

## TODOs

- [ ] Phil JSON:
  - add cursor selection ranges to JSON output
- [ ] rntz JSON:
  - Add selections (including the anchor)
  - Multiple cursors
  - Buffer filename should be null if nonexistent
  - camelCase

@rntz sez: "maybe we should put all these files in a ~/.cursorless/ directory?"

## Notes

**what phil's fork of the cursorless vscode plugin does**

1. writes hats to a file when there's a change to those hats

**phil next steps**

- Migrate "watch JB/Emacs editor state and tell VS Code to navigate to that same
  location (thus updating the hats)"logic to cursorless fork
  (file watcher)

- Make new JetBrains plugin also publish standardized \~/.editor-state.json,
  since it\'s current JSON is overly complicated for this use case

- Export forked changes in knausj VSCode command server

- Export changes from custom command server

**rntz next steps**

- ~~Install and get building (./build)~~

- Get emacs reading \~/.vscode-hats.json and applying hats

- Think about how commands will be sent to visual studio code\
  *issue: *vscode "command server"waits for a keystroke to tell it to read a
  file talon writes to execute cursorless commands. just use a file watcher?

    - Get the knausj VSCode\* actions (most importantly
      vscode_with_plugin_and_wait) to work without VS Code being focused (ie
      from the talon REPL)

*hooks I might need:*

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Change-Hooks.html

- buffer contents change: after-change-functions

- view changes

- current buffer changes

- cursor/selection change

post-command-hook?

**both next steps**

- Think about temporary files for contents

**things to standardize:**

- paths of JSON files

    - \~/.editor-state.json

    - \~/.vscode-hats.json

- schema of JSON files

**Old (before 5/14/22)**

- serialize editor state to file, at the moment:

- a serial number

- current file path

- top & bottom visible lines

edge case: long lines without wrapping, does cursorless hat them?

looks like it does.

- where the cursors/selections are

- watch file from talon or vscode

- vscode draws hats and serializes to a file

- editor watches hat-file and draws hats

problem: how to draw hats in emacs? what if hats are out of date wrt file?

- issue a cursorless command

- goes to vscode via a command server

- vscode edits the file and saves, tells talon it\'s done

- editor either watches the file or is told to reload

eg. "air bat cap <cursorless command> drum each fine"

**Design Stuff**

**Things to think about**

- Think about how cursorless-talon gets published, because it\'s part of
  cursorless.git. Pokey publishes this as a separate repository which people
  clone.

- How the temporary files will work

    - How we will apply changes in the superior editor after detecting changes
      to the temporary files


- **problem: **synchrony problems when chaining between normal and cursorless
  commands?

    - solution: wait for the cursorless command to get processed before running
      subsequent commands


- **bigger problem **: Synchronization problems when using the keyboard are also
  using cursorless commands and/ or chaining cursorless commands with normal
  commands at the same time

**Emacs implementation**

*possible future concerns:*

- performance overhead of the post-command-hook

- detect when things haven't changed

- use temporary files to communicate buffer state

**JetBrains implementation**

- debouncing the updating of the JSON state file

**File Formats**
